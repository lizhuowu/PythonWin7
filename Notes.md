## All Versions

- Build from a path that doesn't contain spaces. Otherwise, you may get an error 9009 when executing `gendef`.
- Set `PATCHDIR` to the location of a release downloaded from https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK. This folder should contain `x86\api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` and `x64\api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll`.

## Python 3.9

- If you get an error during documentation build saying that `itircl.dll` was not registered correctly, go to `externals\windows-installer\htmlhelp` and run `regsvr32 itcc.dll`. Or you can install HTML Help Compiler system-wide, which would register this DLL anyway.
- Install Sphinx 3.5.4 to a Python 3.6 venv and set `PYTHON` to the location of the Python executable.
- Apply `add-dll.patch`.
